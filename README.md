# CookingCharts
Charts to help with the cooking process. When I cook, my food always comes out at different times. I have a hard time visualizing the process in my head. That's why I created these Cooking Gantt Charts.

## Usage
Download Cooking_Timeline_App.R and run with R Studio to view cooking timelines.

## Contents
* Cooking_Timeline_App_v3.R - The main shiny app file. Download this app and run it with R Studio to see the Gantt Charts that are available.
* cooking_timeline_generation.R - File containing the code used to generate new cooking timelines based on an input URL containing a website with a recipe. 
* recipe1.txt - a recipe 
* Cooking_Tasks_Timing.xlsx - File containing data for how long each cooking task takes. Used to create the data used for the Gantt Charts. Data input by hand based on my best guess of how long each activity takes.

### Please help me make this app a reality so I can get better at cooking!
